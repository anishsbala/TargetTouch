# TargetTouch
Target Touch is an innovative finger-tracking game that transforms your hand movements into an immersive target-shooting experience. Players can select their difficulty level—easy, medium, or hard—each offering unique challenges and increasing speed as targets appear on screen. 

The project was developed using Python, utilizing several libraries:
- OpenCV: For capturing webcam input and processing images.
- MediaPipe: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- Random: For generating random target positions on the screen.
- Time: For managing time-sensitive game mechanics.
